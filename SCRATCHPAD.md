## Session notes

### 2026-06-16/17

Built out all project MD files from scratch (.claude/CLAUDE.md, .claude/schema.md,
tasks/lessons.md, SCRATCHPAD.md). Schema verified against live Sheets data via
Apps Script doGet endpoint.

Rebuilt whats_new automation end to end. Routines sandbox blocks
script.google.com, so built a GitHub Actions proxy layer:
Routine → GitHub dispatch API → .github/workflows/append-whats-new.yml →
Apps Script doPost → Sheets. Pipeline confirmed working.

Issues fixed along the way:
- Workflow file not pushed to remote (first 404)
- Python multi-line block in YAML caused trigger parse issue → rewrote with env: pattern
- Apps Script doPost missing: doGet was missing closing `}`, so doPost was nested inside it
- New deployment URL (AKfycbxGOh2...) needed explicit new version after code save
- curl -L -X POST forced POST on 302 redirect → removed -X POST, fixed

**ACTION NEEDED:** Delete the test row from the whats_new tab in Google Sheets:
"Test / Test / 16 Jun 2026 / Test. / Tool Launch / (blank)"
